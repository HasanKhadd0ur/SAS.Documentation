# SAS Platform Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation repository for the **Situational Awareness System (SAS)** platform.

This site is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator designed for building high-quality documentation websites.

## 📖 About the SAS Platform

The SAS platform is designed for real-time event detection and situational awareness based on social media data. It leverages AI, NLP, and microservices architecture to:

- Detect and classify real-world events (crimes, disasters, etc.)
- Visualize them on an interactive map
- Allow users to review historical events, receive region-based notifications, and more

This documentation provides technical references for developers, contributors, and users of the SAS system.

This blog introduces the goals of the SAS project and highlights the architecture and technologies used.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why SAS?\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial media has become a primary source of real-time information. Our system leverages this by continuously scraping and analyzing data from platforms like Telegram and Twitter to identify events as they unfold.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Architecture Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nSAS follows a modular microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for a specific task, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Scraping social media content\\r\\n- Detecting events using deep learning\\r\\n- Inferring location data\\r\\n- Managing user subscriptions and interests\\r\\n- Exposing data through a unified gateway\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s Next?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn upcoming blog posts, we will dive deeper into each component of the SAS system, show how we implemented machine learning for event detection, and discuss the CI/CD process for deploying the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nStay tuned!"}]}}')}}]);
